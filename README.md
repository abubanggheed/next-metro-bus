# Description

This is a challange once used by Target to test up and comming web developers.
The idea is, the code must find the time until the next "bus" leaving from a certain "bus stop" going "direction" arrives. This can be accomplished by using the api at http://svc.metrotransit.org/

This project is a clean react form, using axios to make api calls. To use, type the name of the bus route, the bus stop, and the direction into the inputs, and enter those inputs. Then, if there is an upcomming bus, the difference in minutes is displayed below on the DOM.

### Setup
This is an npm project. After cloning or downloading, use npm install to download in the dependencies.
